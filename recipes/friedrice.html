            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make your rice in a rice cooker.</li>
                        <ul>    
                            <li>Let's be real here, you could totally do it the old fashioned way. But, if you're new to the area, it might be a good idea to get a cheap little robot to help you do it perfect every time.</li>
                            <li>Most white rice is a 2 to 1 ratio. 2 cups water, 1 cup rice. 4 cups water, 2 cups of rice. 2 cups of rice is a fair amount.</li>
                            <li>Rinse your rice first. There's rice dust in the bag, rice dust turns into glue when you get it wet. In this case we don't want sticky rice.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Cool the rice down.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At least room temp-ish, definitely not hot and steamy.</li>
                            <li>Using left over rice is definately supported.</li>
                            <li>Make sure to "fluff" your rice. The grains of rice not sticking to eachother is ideal.</li>
                        </ul> 
                    <li>Get everything ready to be easily tossed in the pan.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This includes:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Scramble your eggs</li>
                                    <li>Put frozen veggies in a bowl that can be easily poured out</li>
                                    <li>Fluff the rice and break up clumps</li>
                                    <li>Put your sauces and spices next to the stove top within close reach.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>This recipe will go better for you with a hot wok and some confidence.</li>
                            <li>This goes a bit faster than you'll have time to think you will not have time to step away to get a forgotten ingredient. Be prepared.</li>
                            <li>The ingredients are used as temperature control and are added as needed to cool the wok.</li>
                            <li>Everything that's added to the wok can be eaten raw. You're cooking for heat and flavor, not "doneness".</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Scrambled eggs are first</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you've never cooked like this before, you'll most likely be impressed with how quick this is.</li>
                            <li>As soon as you add the eggs, place the bowl down. This will take both hands, shake the eggs in the pan with one hand while you stir them around with the spoodle in the other.</li>
                            <li>The eggs will coagulate in seconds, once solid remove them and place them on your plate to be added again in a moment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Return wok to burner and reheat for veggies</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every ingredient requires a hot, oiled pan to keep from sticking. If it not hot or not oiled you will most likely burn everything to the bottom</li>
                            <li>Oil burn in hot pans. One optional and totally dangerous step is wiping the remaining oil out with a rag between ingredients. If you get oil on you skin, that skin will soon blister, rest assured.</li>
                            <li>Use the same two-handded "wok and spoodle" technique discussed in the previous step.</li>
                            <li>Unload next to eggs on your plate.</li>
                            <li>If you did it like a pro, the veggies will have some browning on the outside and the pan will be the perfect temperature for the main event.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Time to cook the rice and finish what we started here</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prep the pan, just like you always do. Since you're a pro now.</li>
                            <li>Once the rice goes in keep it costantly moving in the pan. If you don't you stick it all to the bottom.</li>
                            <li>Add you cooked ingredients and break up the scramled eggs while you toss the devil out of it Briefly. BRIEFLY!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>It's starting to stick!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Goosefraba, we will use the liquid to loosen it all back up.</li>
                            <li>Move fast here, they call it finishing for a reason.</li>
                            <li>Add your sesame oil. This will help keep the now hot rice from sticking while you finish cooking you dinner.</li>
                            <li>Soy sauce, mirin and rice wine vinegar all need to be added here and cooked briefly. This liquid will serve as you last chance to cool the pan down if you need to. Briefly reduce the liquid. BRIEFLY! </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Empty pan onto plate and eat like a king for under $5.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You should probably let it cool down first.</li>
                            <li>Every time you make this it will be better than last time.</li>
                            <li>All cooking is applied science.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>If you still want to cook some meat as well</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cut up some meat onto small, even chunks</li>
                            <li>Toss it in the wok with some salt and pepper</li>
                            <li>If you need detailed instructions to seer cubed meat, you might find this recipe difficult.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                </ol>
            <h3>Seasoning:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have purposely left out optional herbs and spices, you'll know what you think needs to be in there.</li>
                    <li>Cook time and instructions vary greatly depending on which spices you choose.</li>
                </ul>
